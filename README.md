# SLQ

StaticListQuery (SLQ) is an helper object on top of Slick for smooth and non-typesage
data two-way databindings with Lists and Maps for plain SQL.

## Motivation

Clojure.

## Contains

* GetResult-binding for Map[String,Any]
* SetParameter-binding for List[Any] (thanks to Stefan Zeiger / https://groups.google.com/d/msg/scalaquery/-aIm1N72FUE/o6iKqEfqp2YJ)

## TODO

* Tests, publish.
